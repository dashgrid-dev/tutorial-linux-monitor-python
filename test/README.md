# Local testing (Docker)

Run the monitor in a Docker container to verify it pushes to Dashgrid Data Buckets — no real Linux host needed.

## Setup

```bash
cp config.test.yaml.example config.test.yaml
# edit config.test.yaml with your api_host, api_key, and bucket IDs
```

## Run

```bash
./test-docker.sh
```

The script mounts the repo into a `python:3.12-slim` container, installs `PyYAML`, and runs `monitor.py` against the `api_host` in `config.test.yaml`.

Ctrl-C to stop. First sample appears after one `interval` (baseline for CPU/network deltas).

### Stop container
If Ctrl-C doesn't clean up (e.g. the terminal was closed), kill the container from another shell:

```bash
docker ps --filter ancestor=python:3.12-slim -q | xargs -r docker kill
```

Metrics reflect the *container*, not your machine — CPU/memory are the container's share, disk is the Docker Desktop VM's virtual disk, network is the container's veth.
